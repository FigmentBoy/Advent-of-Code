# Advent of Code
All of my advent of code solutions for every year it's been running!

It's important to note that I only started participating in AoC during the 2020 year, so anything from 2015-2019 was not done during the contest period. I decided to do them nonetheless so I could have all stars from all years.

I'm mainly doing this to back up my work, I have accidentally deleted my entire AoC folder once before so I want that not to happen again. All solutions are in Python, but in future years I may look into using languages such as Rust or C++.
